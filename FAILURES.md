## 2026-10-17 · Planning: SDK major-version drift
- **What broke:** Most MCP tutorials (and model training data) use `FastMCP` from the v1 SDK. In `mcp` 2.x it was renamed to `MCPServer`, so v1-style code fails on import.
- **What changed:** Pinned `mcp>=2.3,<3` and added an explicit rule to `AGENTS.md` so the implementer does not fall back to v1 APIs.
- **What happened next:** Caught before any code was written.
