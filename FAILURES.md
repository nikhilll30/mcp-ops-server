# Failure log

What broke, what changed, what happened next. Newest first.

## 2026-10-17 · CI: secret scan failed only on pull requests
- **What broke:** `gitleaks-action@v2` passed on the `push` run but failed on the `pull_request` run for the same commit.
- **What changed (attempt 1):** Scoped the secrets job to `push` events, claiming coverage was unchanged.
- **What was wrong with that:** Codex's independent review (P1) caught that fork PRs never trigger this repo's push workflow, so external contributions would skip the scan until after merge.
- **What changed (attempt 2):** Replaced the action with the gitleaks CLI in a container, run on both `push` and `pull_request`, with a read-only token (`permissions: contents: read`) and no secrets exposed to PR code.
- **Lesson:** "Coverage is unchanged" was an untested claim. Independent review is worth it.

## 2026-10-17 · Workflow: agent-to-agent delegation over GitHub mentions
- **What broke:** `@codex` PR comments got no response after the environment was set up; `@cursor` replied only with a Bugbot upsell.
- **What changed:** Claude implements; Codex is used as an independent reviewer at the end of each part.
- **What happened next:** Fewer hand-offs, and every part now gets a second-model review.

## 2026-10-17 · Planning: SDK major-version drift
- **What broke:** Most MCP tutorials (and model training data) use `FastMCP` from the v1 SDK. In `mcp` 2.x it was renamed to `MCPServer`, so v1-style code fails on import.
- **What changed:** Pinned `mcp>=2.3,<3` and added an explicit rule to `AGENTS.md` so the implementer does not fall back to v1 APIs.
- **What happened next:** Caught before any code was written.
